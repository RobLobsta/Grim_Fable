      "startingPrompt": "The morning light filters through the cottage windows, but the usual warmth of the hearth is missing. Little Red opens her eyes to a silence that feels heavy and wrong. No bread baking, no soft humming from the kitchen—only the distant, lonely call of a bird from the Black Forest. She calls out for Grandmother, but her voice only echoes back from the empty rooms. The bed is neatly made, but Grandmother is nowhere to be found. Something is wrong. Little Red must find her.",
      "loreContext": "The village is the last bastion of safety, but even here, the shadows seem longer. Little Red has just discovered her grandmother is missing, and the silence in the cottage is deafening. The path to the forest entrance is a winding trail through autumn fields, now feeling more like a gauntlet. The environment should feel oppressive, with the silhouettes of the Black Forest looming in the distance like ancient, watchful giants.",
      "hiddenKnowledge": "Encourage clever branches: the player might find Grandmother's Red Hood hidden under the floorboards or find her Basket abandoned near the well. Moral dilemmas: help a suspicious villager for information or prioritize speed? Skill-based paths: use keen observation to find clues or use social standing to rally the villagers. The player's choice of equipment at the end of this chapter will determine their class upgrade: Sword (Knight), Bow (Ranger), Herbs (Apothecary), Spellbook (Witch), Rosary (Nun), or Wrench (Mechanic).",
