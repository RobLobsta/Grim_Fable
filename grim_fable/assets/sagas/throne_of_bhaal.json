  "loreContext": "The Sword Coast is a region of beauty and betrayal, with the city of Baldur's Gate at its heart. Bhaal, the former Lord of Murder, has been newly resurrected but remains amnesiac, wandering the world as a man who feels he should be important but can't remember why. The atmosphere is one of 'tragicomic absurdity'—where cosmic irony meets gallows humor. Lexicon: [Bhaal: The amnesiac Lord of Murder], [Baldur's Gate: A city of coin and cutthroats], [Flaming Fist: The city's brutal mercenary police], [Cespenar: A sarcastic imp butler], [The Grinning Skull: A mocking, talking skull], [Divine Essence: Fragments of godhood], [Infamy: Your reputation as a harbinger of death].",
