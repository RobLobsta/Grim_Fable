# Grim Fable 🗡️📖

Welcome to **Grim Fable**, an AI-driven dark fantasy text adventure for Android. Forge your legend, embark on perilous journeys, and watch as your character's history is written by the fates.

## Features

- **Forge Your Soul**: Create unique characters with AI-generated or custom backstories.
- **Eternal Chronicles**: Every adventure you take is saved in your character's history.
- **Dynamic Storytelling**: Powered by advanced AI to provide a unique, gritty fantasy experience.
- **Persistent Progression**: Your character's backstory evolves based on the adventures you complete.

## How to Play

### 1. Forge Your Character
When you first open the app, tap **BEGIN JOURNEY** to create your first character.
- **Name**: Give your hero a name.
- **Backstory**: Either type your own or use **AI DIVINATION** to generate a dark origin story.
- Tap **FORGE LEGEND** to save.

### 2. Embark on Adventures
From the Home Screen, you can:
- Tap **CONTINUE ADVENTURE** to pick up where you last left off.
- Tap **NEW ADVENTURE** to start a completely fresh chapter.
- Tap **VIEW CHRONICLES** to see your character's past adventures.

### 3. Playing the Game
Once in an adventure:
- Read the story segments generated by the AI.
- Type your actions in the field at the bottom (e.g., "I open the ancient chest" or "I draw my sword").
- Tap the **Send** icon to see how the world responds.

### 4. Completing a Chronicle
When you feel an adventure has reached a natural conclusion or a major milestone:
- Tap the **Done** icon (double checkmarks) in the top right.
- This will summarize your adventure and **permanently update your character's backstory** to include these events.
- Once completed, an adventure can be read in the Chronicles but cannot be continued.

## Tips for the Best Experience

- **Be Descriptive**: The AI responds best to specific actions and intent.
- **Stay in Character**: Roleplay as your hero for a more immersive experience.
- **Embrace the Dark**: Grim Fable is designed for dark fantasy; expect challenges, mysteries, and grit.

## Technical Notes

Grim Fable uses the **Hugging Face Inference API** for storytelling.
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
- If using your own API key, configure it in the `lib/core/services/ai_provider.dart` file.
